- Built on the native fetch API; all fetch options remain valid.
- Automatic JSON parsing and payload stringification, configurable per request or globally.
- Defaults: `Content-Type: application/json`, `Accept: */*` (override anytime).
- Upload/Download progress via `onUploadProgress`/`onDownloadProgress` (uses XHR under the hood when needed).
- Streaming helpers: `streamToString`, `streamToBlob`, `streamToArrayBuffer`, `streamChunks` for efficient large data handling.
- Hooks (aka interceptors): `onRequest`, `onResponse`, `onError` with helper methods for easy mutations.
- Open source and community-driven — issues and PRs welcome!
